## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at <a href="https://www.imse.iastate.edu/" target="_blank"> Iowa State University</a>, working under the mentorship of<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FNN93g0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Dr. Qing Li</a>. I am broadly interested in developing theory and methodology for analyzing large-scale and complex-structured data to address scientific problems arising from interdisciplinary studies. My current research focuses on using deep neural network to understand complex systems and improve system performance.

Prior to the Ph.D. program, I obtained a Master's degree in Statistics from the <a href="https://cdis.wisc.edu/" target = "_blank"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. During this period, I worked as a Research Cyberinfrastructure Project Assistant in the Office of Chief Technology Officer<a href="https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/research-cyberinfrastructure-2/" target="_blank"> (CTO)</a> for two years, where I developed and deployed multiple production-grade data management systems for the university. I received my Bachelor's degrees, B.S. in Statistics and B.A. in Economics from the<a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/" target = "_blank"> University of Minnesota Duluth</a>.

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.  -->
